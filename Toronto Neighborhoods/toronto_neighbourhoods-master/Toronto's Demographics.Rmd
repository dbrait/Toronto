Using the Well Being set from the 2011 census, available on the city of <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=4482904ade9ea410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD>Toronto's open data portal</a>.  Inspiried by Myles Harrison from his blog <a href="http://www.everydayanalytics.ca/">everydayanalytics</a>, I thought it would be interesting to look at the breakdown of different ethnicities across the city, as definied by the person's mother tongue.  To see if the historical areas of ethnic congregations (i.e Little Italy, Little Portgual, Little India, etc) still help up today.  

## Portugese

Portugese was most predominant in the central west part of the city, chiefly the Dovercourt-Wallace Emersion-Junction neighborhood, with over 6,000 native tongue portugese (close to 20% of the neighborhood).  The Portugese presence spilled over into neighboring areas like Weston-Pellam Park, Corso-Italia Davenport, Caledonia-Fairbank, Keelesdale-Eglington West, Oakwood Village, Rockcliffe-Smythe, Dufferin Grove, Palmerston-Little Italy, Trinity Bellwoods and Little Portugal.

## Italian

Italians appear to have migrated north through the years, from the traditional College st Little Italy.  Downsview-Roding-CFB leads the city in Italian population, with neighboring areas of Glenfield-Jane Heights, York University Heights, Yorkdale-Glen Park and Maple Leaf with sizeable presences.  The more traditional areas of Oakwood Village and Corso Italia-Davenport also still have significant populations

## Urdu

Urdu has a very strong pocket of presence in Thorncliffe Park and Flemingdon Park, right in the middle of the city.  The rest of the population is scattered in the Northwest (West Humber-Clairville, Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown, Kingsview Village-The Westway)   and Northeast (Rouge, Malvern, Wobourn) far reaches of Toronto.
